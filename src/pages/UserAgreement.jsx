                  Trading, Transactions, and storage of Digital Assets are
                  accompanied by significant risks. Prices may fluctuate daily.
                  Such price fluctuations can increase or decrease the price of
                  a particular User's Digital Asset at any time. Any currency,
                  whether virtual or not, can be subject to significant
                  fluctuations in price, as well as completely devalued. There
                  is the usual risk of losses as a result of buying, selling or

                  Trading in Digital assets is also associated with special
                  risks that are usually not typical for Fiat money and/or
                  commodities and/or commodity (non-virtual/digital) assets.
                  Unlike most government-backed Fiat Money, Digital assets are
                  unique types of assets supported by technology and trust.
                  There is no central bank that can issue more currency or take
                  measures to protect the value of Digital Assets in a crisis.{" "}

                  Irrational (or rational) market "bubbles" or a loss of
                  confidence in Digital Assets often occur in the Digital asset
                  market, which can lead to a drop in demand compared to supply.
                  For example, trust in Digital Assets may fall due to
                  unexpected changes introduced by software developers or
                  others, government measures, the creation of better
                  competitive alternative digital assets, as well as
                  deflationary or inflationary spirals. The level of trust can
                  also be reduced due to technical problems: if the anonymity of
                  the system is compromised, if assets are lost or stolen, or if
                  hackers or authorities prevent Transactions.{" "}

                  During the Penalty Period, GlobeFi applies an appropriate
                  penalty, which is 25% of the amount of the coin/token that is
                  being Delisted and which the User owns on the first day of the
                  Penalty Period. GlobeFi charges such a fine once every 30

                  end of the Penalty Period (if such was provided to the User).
