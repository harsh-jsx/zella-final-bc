          In the process of due diligence and KYC and in order to open an
          account, person’s identity, information about a person provided and
          documents submitted have to be verified and checked against sanctions

        <h2>Monitoring, risk assessment and risk-based approach</h2>
        <p>
          {" "}
          The Compliance Officer conducts investigations for incoming and
          outgoing transactions based on various factors, including the security
          system for automatic verification of transactions, the specified
          verification time period takes up to 24 hours. GlobeFi carries out
          customer’s transactions monitoring, risk‐assessment and suspicious
          activity detection. For that purpose it uses specially developed
          system, including using a high-performance tools.{" "}

        <p>
          {" "}
          GlobeFi uses risk-based approach to combating/preventing money laundry
          and/or financing terrorism.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          {" "}
          To assist in determining the level of AML/CFT due diligence to be
          exercised with regard to the customer, a compliance risk profile is
          calculated first of all on entry into relations (Low, Medium, High),
          and is then recalculated routinely.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          {" "}
          AML/CFT compliance ensures that an ongoing transaction monitoring is
          conducted to detect transactions which are unusual or suspicious
          compared to the customer profile.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          {" "}
          Determination of the unusual nature of one or more transactions
          essentially depends on a subjective assessment, in relation to the
          knowledge of the customer (KYC), their financial behaviour and the
          transaction counterparty.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          {" "}
          If a transaction is inconsistent with a customer’s known personal
          usual activities or personal habits, this transaction may be
          considered suspicious. Data and transaction monitoring tools are used
          to identify unusual/uncommon patterns of customer’s activity. After
          review and investigation, it is Compliance Officer’s decision whether
          to file a SAR or not.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          {" "}
          Once a SAR is filed with a relevant agency, a copy of filing
          documentation is maintained. SAR filing is confidential and only the
          GlobeFi’s employees involved in the investigation and reporting
          process will be aware of its existence.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          {" "}
          All records are retained for no less than (5) years and are available
          upon official request by an authorized examiner, regulator, or law
          enforcement agency.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          {" "}
          Any GlobeFi staff member must inform the Compliance Officer of any
          atypical transactions which they observe and cannot attribute to a
          lawful activity or source of income known of the customer.{" "}
