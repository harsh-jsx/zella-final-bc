          </h3>
          <p>
            The General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) is EU privacy and
            data protection law. It calls for more granular privacy guardrails
            in an organization’s systems, more nuanced data protection
            agreements, and more consumer-friendly and detailed disclosures
            about an organization’s privacy and data protection practices.
          </p>
          <p>
            This Regulation applies to the processing of Personal Data wholly or
            partly by automated means, and to the processing other than by
            automated means of Personal Data which form part of a filing system
            or are intended to form part of a filing system. Generally, The GDPR
            requirements apply to all companies, institutions, and organizations
            that process Personal Data.

          <h3 id="processing-personal-data-is-a-broad-concept-under-the-gdpr">
            Processing Personal Data is a broad concept under the GDPR
          </h3>
          <p>
            The GDPR governs how the Personal Data of individuals may be
            processed by organizations. “Personal Data” and “processing” are
            frequently used terms in the legislation, and understanding their
            particular meanings under the GDPR illuminates the true reach of
            this law:
          </p>
          <p>
            Personal Data is any information relating to an identified or
            identifiable individual. This is a very broad concept because it
            includes any information that could be used on its own or in
            combination with other pieces of information to identify a person.
            Personal Data is not just a person’s name or e-mail address. It can
            also encompass information such as financial information or even, in
            some cases, an IP address. Moreover, certain categories of Personal
            Data are given a higher level of data protection because of their
            sensitive nature and are not processed. These categories of data are
            information about an individual’s racial and ethnic origin,
            political opinions, religious and philosophical beliefs, trade union
            membership, genetic data, biometric data, health data, information
            about a person’s sex life or sexual orientation, and criminal record
            information (including Personal Data about criminal offenses, or
            alleged offenses).
          </p>
          <p>
            Processing Personal Data is the key activity that triggers
            obligations under the GDPR. Processing means any operation or set of
            operations that is performed on Personal Data or on sets of Personal
            Data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection,
            recording, organization, structuring, storage, adaptation or
            alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by
            transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment
            or combination, restriction, erasure, or destruction. In practical
            terms, this means any process that stores or consults Personal Data
            is considered processing.
          </p>
          <h3 id="the-gdpr-can-apply-to-organizations-located-outside-the-eu">
            The GDPR can apply to organizations located outside the EU
          </h3>
          <p>
            The GDPR is relevant to any globally operating company, not just
            those located in the EU. Under the GDPR, organizations may be in
            scope if (i) the organization is established in the EU, or (ii) the
            organization is not established in the EU, but the data processing
            activities are with regard to EU individuals and relate to the
            offering of goods and services to them or the monitoring of their
            behavior.
