            <h3>1. Compliance Management</h3>
            <p></p>
            <p>
              Our dedicated team of experts ensures that we follow strict
              compliance standards and protocols. Our team follows a
              comprehensive compliance management framework, which is overseen
              by senior management, to identify, assess, execute and evaluate
              effectively.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is our responsibility to examine and identify any risks to or
              regarding our platform, and follow through with any necessary
              remediation. External risks may refer to those that may arise from
              outside circumstances, such as incorrect information published by
              third-party advertisements from Bitget affiliates. Internal risks
              refer to those that may arise from within our organization, such
              as unauthorized, inappropriate, illegal, or unethical actions
              taken by our employees.
            </p>
            <p>
              In conjunction with our assessments and annual compliance reviews,
              we work with local regulators to ensure our compliance standards
              adhere to regional requirements.
            </p>
            <p></p>
            <h3>2. eKYC</h3>
            <p></p>
            <p>
              We use extensive eKYC procedures to safeguard our platform and
              mitigate any potential risk from fraud and illicit behavior. We
              have established proper sanctions and anti-money laundering
              policies to ensure we comply with all relevant jurisdictions and
              prevent counterfeiting or other criminal activities on the
              platform.
            </p>
            <p>
              Efficiency is crucial to our Customer Due Diligence (CDD). To
              optimise the KYC process without compromising compliance, we
              utilize eKYC technology. This includes enabling facial recognition
              and auto cross-matching between provided identification and live
              self-portraits, thus preventing the risk of impersonation. As a
              result, the identity verification process on Bitget is drastically
              shortened.
            </p>
            <p></p>
            <h3>3. Blockchain Analytics</h3>
            <p></p>
            <p>
              External blockchain analytical tools are deployed to closely
              monitor transactions on our platform and reduce this risk of
              fraudulent activities and the appearance of high-risk clients*.
              Due to the immutability and transparency of public blockchains, we
              are able to thoroughly examine transactions conducted on our
              platform.
            </p>
            <p>*High-risk clients include, but are not limited to:</p>
            <p>- Clients from certain nations or regions</p>
            <p>- Government officials</p>
            <p>
              - Clients from certain industries (e.g., cash-intensive
              businesses)
            </p>
            <p>
              Depending on assessments from our Risk &amp; Governance team, we
              will employ various measures for high-risk clients. This may
              include seizing assets or requesting more frequent reviews or
              audits, depending on the circumstances.
            </p>
            <p></p>
            <h3>4. Cybersecurity</h3>
            <p></p>
            <p>
              We consult with independent cybersecurity experts to improve the
              security and stability of our platform. Penetration testing and
              vulnerability assessments are conducted on our network biannually
              and, if potential threats are detected, correction is swift.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition to the aforementioned tests, we encrypt all sensitive
              data to prevent theft and unauthorized access or modification. All
              data that is transmitted or held is encrypted and stored securely
              in fault-tolerant storage.
